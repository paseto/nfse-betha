# Certificates Directory

This directory should contain your .pfx certificate files for NFSe Betha integration.

**Important:** Certificate files should NOT be committed to version control for security reasons.

## Setup Instructions:

1. Place your .pfx certificate file in this directory
2. Update the certificate path and password in the configuration
3. Ensure proper file permissions (readable by web server only)

## Example:
```
certificates/
├── .gitkeep              # This file (for git tracking)
├── certificado.pfx       # Your certificate file (not in git)
└── README.md             # Instructions (optional)
```

## Security Notes:
- Keep certificate files secure and private
- Use environment variables for passwords in production
- Regularly rotate certificates as needed
- Monitor certificate expiration dates
